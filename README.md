# Diabetes-Feature-Engineering

## Business Problem
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

## Dataset History
The dataset is part of a large dataset maintained at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

## Project Tasks
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
